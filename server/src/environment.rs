/*
 * server/src/environment.rs
 *
 * Purpose: Manages the static and dynamic elements of the game world environment,
 *          excluding player-specific state.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - `seed_environment`: Populates the world with initial resources (trees, stones, mushrooms)
 *                         on server startup if the environment is empty. Uses helpers from `utils.rs`.
 *   - `check_resource_respawns`: Checks periodically if any depleted resources (trees, stones,
 *                                mushrooms with `respawn_at` set) are ready to respawn.
 *                                Uses a macro from `utils.rs` for conciseness.
 *
 * Note: Resource definitions (structs, constants) are in their respective modules (e.g., `tree.rs`).
